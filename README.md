# Ethereum_fraud_detection
This repository implements a deep learning–based fraud detection system for Ethereum using graph neural networks (GNNs). The project focuses on pattern recognition in transaction graphs, learning behavioral and structural signals associated with fraudulent wallets.  All models and pipelines are implemented from scratch in PyTorch,
